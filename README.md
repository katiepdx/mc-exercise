Bob and Carol didn't pull from master so they didn't have the most recent version to work on. 
The team could have been more communicative before merging althuogh this isn't always possible in larger teams.
They should've remembered to pull origin master early and often!
This will ensure everyone is always working off the most up to date branch before adding new features and merging to the master branch.
